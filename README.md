# Next.js E-commerce Store with Jest Testing

This project was part of Module 3 of Fabio Vedovelli's course "Testar aplicaÃ§Ãµes javascript".

The project is a fully tested eCommerce store simulation built with Next.js and Jest. It allows users to browse products, add items to the cart and remove as desired. Implemented with the test-driven development (TDD) methodology, the project has 100% test coverage, using the Jest library, ensuring that all application functionalities are tested and validated, providing a safe and reliable purchasing experience for users.
